Front end assignment: Display a score board of some super duper mega special robots.

### Instructions

The app should use [React](https://reactjs.org/) as a framework. You can use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) as a boilerplate.

Clone or fork this repository, it contains the local assets needed. When you're done, send us a link to your work.

#### Design
* The designs are provided to you on a separate URL
* Write responsive CSS, see the design for the look in desktop and mobile
* Feel free to use a CSS framework, or write vanilla CSS
* The fonts in use are [Nunito Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito+Sans) for body text and list items, and [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) for the headline

#### Functionality
* Load the JSON data from the URL provided to you
* Images in the JSON data should be loaded from the provided URL
* Create a dynamic list of available categories from the JSON data, this list should not be hard coded into the app
* The list should be able to be filtered by categories
* The list should be able to be sorted by `name` or `score`
* Text search: this should do a case insensitive search in the robot names
* The filter list should be possible to toggle via a Show/hide button
* The app only needs to work in modern browsers, no need to do backwards compatibility
* It should be possible to "star" robots, and then filter out those. The starring should be persistent, possibly by using localStorage, or any other technique you might prefer
* (Optional) If you want to do more advanced state management you can use [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
